# Reallity Reader
I built the first prototype on Android, which allows users to simply point their device at any text and hear it read out loud in real-time. This augments reality to assist people in better understanding and engaging with their surroundings.
In the future, I envision expanding RealityReader AR's capabilities to accommodate multiple languages, more complex texts, and even full documents. By constantly evolving and refining this groundbreaking technology, I believe we can empower individuals with diverse abilities and create a more inclusive society.
