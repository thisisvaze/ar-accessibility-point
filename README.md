As a passionate developer, I always look for innovative ways to make the world a better place with technology. Driven by the desire to promote accessibility, I created RealityReader AR, a project designed to make the world more interactive and accessible for everyone, especially for those with reading difficulties or visual impairments.

I built the first prototype on Android, which allows users to simply point their device at any text and hear it read out loud in real-time. This augments reality to assist people in better understanding and engaging with their surroundings.
In the future, I envision expanding RealityReader AR's capabilities to accommodate multiple languages, more complex texts, and even full documents. By constantly evolving and refining this groundbreaking technology, I believe we can empower individuals with diverse abilities and create a more inclusive society.
